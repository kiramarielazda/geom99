    <p>Leaflet is a lightweight, mobile-friendly, open-source JavaScript library for customizing interactive maps. 
      Leaflet supports HTML5 and CSS3, and the interface also works with numerous web mapping applications such as 
      Google Maps API, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap. Designed with simplicity in mind, its source code is easily readable and simple to work with. 
      Leaflet also supports many file formats including shapefiles, GeoJSON, and KML.</p>

    <div id="Leaflet">
      <h2> Open Street Map, Leaflet and KMZ files</h2>
      <h3> Overview:</h3>
      <p>The use of Open Street Map (OSM) and leaflet have been a suitable combination for web trail mapping needs. Open street maps provides a variety of different base maps inclusive with an array of base data not always seen in other open-source base maps. Combined with the simplicity of Leaflet's open-source JavaScript Library web mapping has never been easier. <p>
      <h3>The Process:</h3>
      <h4>What Works:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Displaying an OpenStreetMap base map from a URL.</li>
      <li>Having an OpenStreetMap base map and using Leaflet’s JavaScript library to display the KMZ filesstored on the GitHub repository.</li>
      <li>Displaying Pop ups for the KMZ point markers.</li>
      <li>The ability to toggle layers on and off.</li>
      <li>Overriding KMZ GPS Styling of point markers to web displayable markers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> What Doesn’t Work:</h4>
      <p>Task 1: Hosting a tiled server over GitHub to host OpenStreetMap Base tiles.</p>
      <p>Result 1:The docker file would not set up correctly to host a server for the OSM tile(s).</p>
      <p>Result 2: Orange “polygon” reflecting from the bends on the Dumoine Trail KMZ file. </p>
      <h3>Working with KMZ files:</h3>
      <p>KMZ files have been seeing their way out over the years and there is a reason why. After extensive testing with the original GPS KMZ file, in multiple platforms it proved to be extremely difficult and arose more problems than working with the GeoJSON, in similar platforms. The KMZ file needed many tweaks to get working with Leaflet and Open Street Map, such as adjusting the markers from the GPS markers, the trail having shadowing around the bends, while the GeoJSON was able to adjust the markers with ease and never had a shadowing issue around the trail bends. The KMZ files in QGIS proved to be just as difficult as the pop ups would not use any other field than ID or FID, whereas shapefiles and other formats were able to display all fields in the pop ups.</p>

<!--Section for Mapbox-->
  <div id="osm">
    <h1>Mapbox <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
      <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>

      <span class="fa fa-star "></span>
      <span class="fa fa-star "></span></h1>
    <p> Mapbox is an open-source provider of impressive custom maps, has created and contributed to several high-performance mapping libraries like Mapbox GL-JS and Leaflet; 
      and has an application called Mapbox Studio for managing your own geospatial data and designing maps. 
      Compared to other options explored here, Mapbox offers a GUI to manage data on a web map while simultaneously providing beautiful base map tiles to work with.  </p>
    <h2>The Process: </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a free Mapbox account and generate an API access token to use on your webpage. </li>
      <li>Open the Mapbox Studio application and create a new style, either by using a predefined map template or starting from an empty map. </li>
      <li>Use the Mapbox Studio application to customize the base map's colors, features, text and more to meet your needs. </li>
      <li>To add your own data to the map, go to Mapbox Studio’s Datasets page and create a new dataset. This opens another application that allows you to draw new features or upload existing data in GeoJSON, JSON or csv format. </li>
      <li>After exporting your data, it can be added to your custom map from the layers tab of the Mapbox Studio Styles application where custom styling of your point, line and polygon data can be done.  </li>
      <li>With your map complete, it is ready to be published and shared using an integration url that can be accessed in your website using Mapbox GL-JS or Leaflet.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a href='https://kiramarielazda.github.io/webcollab/leafletTest.html'> Check out the Mapbox map here!</a></h4>
    <h2>Lessons Learned: </h2>
    <h3> Benefits </h3>
      <li> Provides users with the opportunity to customize and design maps to suit their needs. </li>
      <li> Does not require any programming for the map design itself. </li>
      <li> Allows 50’000 free map loads and 200’000 free static tile requests per month, which is suitable for clients looking for low-cost web mapping solutions. </li>
      <li>Easy data integration with the map </li>
      <li>Mapbox offers detailed tutorials and documentation to support users throughout the design and implementation process. </li>
    <h3> Shortcomings </h3>
      <li> The interactivity of the map must be programmed using Mapbox GL-JS or Leaflet, which proved to be a steep learning curve. </li>
      <li> Requires a Mapbox account and API token, which may be a deterrent to some clients. </li>
    <h2> Takeaways</h2>
      <p>For our collaborative project, we will design a custom Mapbox base map to use in our interactive map, however, since we have dedicated more time to learning Leaflet and GeoJSON, we will keep our trail data separate from Mapbox. 
          Using Mapbox simply for the basemap will make the map easier to update should we or our client need to make changes to our GeoJSON trail data. Ideally, the Mapbox basemap
          will not need to be adjusted once we hand off the project because our client is not experienced with the platform. We are looking forward to exploring all the design options available
          within Mapbox Studio to make our trail's basemap attractive and informative.</p>

<!-- Section for QGIS-->
  <div id="qgis">
    <h1>QGIS <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
      <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>

      <span class="fa fa-star "></span>
      <span class="fa fa-star "></span></h1>
    <p>QGIS, being an open-source program with a rich variety of functionality, was worth looking into for base mapping needs. The program proved to be difficult to produce an effective functional Web map.
      As seen in the above section working with KMZ files is not ideal and many errors in QGIS were due to working with the KMZ files. After testing similar processes with
      a shapefile, many of the program crashes remained. With the only difference being the pop ups allowed more than the ID or FID field while working with shapefiles.<p>
    <h2>The Process:</h2>
    <h4>What Works:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop application: Importing data, geoprocessing, styling, and symbology.</li>
      <li>QGIS2Web Plugin: Downloadable plugin to create Web maps using either OpenLayers, Leaflet, or Mapbox GL JS as outputs.</li>
      <li>Pop ups: Creating pop up boxes for layers (Widgets in QGIS).</li>
      <li>Exporting a web map with the OpenLayers extension.</li>
      <li>Exporting a web map with the MapBox GL JS extension.</li>
      <li>Exporting and Hosting a QGIS leaflet exported map with the KMZ markers rendered as a “single value” and shapefiles (waterbody, river, road, tote road trail).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> What Doesn’t Work:</h4>
    <p>Task 1: Exporting the KML/KMZ styled Tote Road Trail markers as “unique values” by “name” as a Leaflet map.</p>
    <p>Result 1: The Python script would fail each time, due to legend styling and crash QGIS desktop application. Tried: Removing all legends, and current styling to single values.</p>
    <p>Result 1.1: The Python script would fail each time, due to a legend styling and crash QGIS desktop application. The result only changed if the KMZ files were completely removed from the project and brought back in and styled as single values.</p>
    <p>Task 2: Importing the exported  OpenLayers Web map or MapBox GL JS Web map and importing them into GitHub.</p>
    <p>Result 2: GitHub would not accept the folders containing the styling for the OpenLayers Web map or the Markers for MapBox GL JS Web map as there were too many styling options (Over 100). Another issue being some files wouldn’t import to GitHub as they were “hidden”.</p>
    <p>Task 3: Inserting specified text into pop ups on KMZ files.</p>
    <p>Result 3: Only the ID or FID fields could be used from the KMZ files for the Web map popups, and the pop ups for the shapefiles weren't easy to filter through.</p>
